## Quick Start

The code was tested with Python 3.6. To use this code, please do:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/oreopie/physics-aware-dl.git
   cd physics-aware-dl
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install numpy==1.16.4 pandas scipy tensorflow==1.14 keras==2.3.1 matplotlib jupyter
   ```

   Note that the latest version of `tensorflow` is `2.0`, while the **core NN layers (P-RNN)** is built under `tensorflow 1.x`. For this implementation, `tensorflow v1.14` is recommended.

3. Download CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies) data set  `CAMELS time series meteorology, observed flow, meta data (.zip) `  from [https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels](https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels). Unzip `basin_timeseries_v1p2_metForcing_obsFlow.zip` and reorganize the directory as follows,

   ```
   camels\
   |---basin_mean_forcing\
   |   |---daymet\
   |       |---01\
   |       |---...	
   |       |---18	\
   |---usgs_streamflow\
       |---01\
       |---...	
       |---18\
   ```

4. Start `Jupyter Notebook` and run the `demo_single.ipynb` locally.
